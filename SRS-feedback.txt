Amplyfy Project SRS Feedback
============================

This is excellent work!  You have done a great job of breaking down the CSCI
into it's component parts, and the descriptions in section 5.2 are great!  The
diagrams you've included provide a very good addition to the text so that the
reader can see easily what the parts are and how they relate to each other.

I have just a few comments.

1) The diagrams need captions like "Figure 1: Frontend Diagram" so that you can
   refer to them in the text.  Number them sequentially, and remove the "5.2.1.2"
   and so on from them.

2) The use of "but not limited to" is really for the requirements, no for the
   headers.  Don't over-use that phrase as you've done here.  Use it for things
   like ".... shall include but not be limited to ....".  This usually appears
   in "will" statements, NOT in "shall" statements.

3) It would be good to divide the sections up with a sub-header to one more
   level.  For example:

   5.3 Functional Requirements
   5.3.1 Frontend
   5.3.1.1  PlayerView
   5.3.1.1.1   The PlayerView shall provide a button that plays the music.
   5.3.1.1.2   The PlayerView shall provide a button that pauses the music.
   5.3.1.1.3   The PlayerView shall provide a button that skips to the next song.

      .......  [and so forth]

That's it!  You guys did a good job of specifying things.  Be sure to watch out for
the word "and" in any requirement statement, which indicates you have more than one
requirement and that statement needs to be split into at least two statements.

Make the changes listed above by the end of the semester for full credit on this assignment.

Initial submission 8% out of 8%, plus 2% out of 2% for the Gantt chart.
      10% out of 10% = 100% which is an A-plus
