Very nice job on this document, as usual!  You guys did a great job saying
how the parts of the project fit together.  Just a couple of observations:

You still need to fix the diagrams in the architecture section, to wit:

Your deployment diagram isn't that.  You can keep the diagram if you just
re-name it to be something like "message interaction flow diagram".

The "frontend" diagram should be re-labeled "user interface example" to
show what it really is.  Also, "frontend" is actually two words....

Again, "backend" is really more of a back end data flow diagram or maybe
a back end "task interaction" diagram.

I like the new diagrams in the new sections!  Nothing to add beyond that.

This is a great job!!

you got 10% out of 10% for this deliverable which is an A-plus.
